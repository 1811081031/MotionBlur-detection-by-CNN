# MotionBlur-detection-by-using-CNN

This project is based on research [started by HAL](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01250478/document) on learning a convolutional neural network for non-uniform motion blur removal. 

This is the folder that constain codes to run my cnn model.

The "data.zip" are available through google drive link below. https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/0B8GhS4dXq_m2UTE5NG9sUVlLZkE/view?usp=sharing

In order to successfully running the code, please first unzip the "data.zip" file and put all all folders "s_cnn","s_oridata","tarimg" and "transimg" into the same folder with the other python codes

After unzipping the data and put them into proper place, you are ready to run the code.To run the cnn model, just enter "cnn.py" and run the code. It might take couple hours to run it if you are using personal computers. Usinga server or GPU to run this code would significantly lower the running time.

Thank you so much!

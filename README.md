# MotionBlur-detection-by-CNN

This project is based on research [started by HAL](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01250478/document) on learning a convolutional neural network for non-uniform motion blur removal. 

This is the folder that constain codes to run my cnn model. 

To run the cnn model, just enter "cnn.py" and run the code. It might take couple hours to run it if you are using personal computers. Usinga server or GPU to run this code would significantly lower the running time.

Thank you so much!
